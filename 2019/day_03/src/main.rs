// Initial solution idea.
//
// The paths are encoded with U, D, L, R instructions as well as a distance for each of these.
// Finding the intersections would mean computing each coordinate and seeing if there's an overlap.
// Then calculating the distance to the origin for each of these, closest wins.
//
// A slightly less na√Øve solution would be to calculate the general equation (requires starting
// and ending coordinates) for each line of the wire paths and calculate the intersection points
// for each of these. Then repeat the distance calculation mentioned above.
